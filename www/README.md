# Mello Trello - Trello Board Printer

Takes live data from Trello API and formats it for printing

### How to run
```
bundle install
cd www
asdf
```

### How to access
Open your browser at http://localhost:9292/index.html?boardId=[yourBoardId]


### Problems? 

You might well need to update the API key in `index.html` as per https://trello.com/app-key 

### Can it be improved? 

Yes, I'm sure it should be possible to do some much neater code and some proper wait/promises on the AJAX calls but for the sake of brevity this works
Feel free to send me a pull request
